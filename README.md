# Tempo E-ink Calendar

### Thanks & Acknowledgements

This project is built on top of [InkyPi](https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi). It has been significantly modified
and reworked for a different use case, but I want to fully acknowledge the work of 
[fatihak](https://github.com/fatihak) and the open source InkyPi project on top of which this was built.

If you are an advanced user who wants more features beyond a calendar, check out the original 
[InkyPi project](https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi). It will run on the same hardware.

If you want to donate anything to this project, just donate instead to [InkyPi](https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi)
or his Patreon.
